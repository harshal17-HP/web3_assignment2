            Gamers love competition. They want to be the best. From 1972 when the winner of the first eSports event received a yearlong subscription to Rolling Stone magazine, to present day where prize pools include up to tens of millions of dollars 9 , winning is at the core of what playing video games is all about. eSports is also accessible. To play a traditional sport you may have to organize people into the same physical location, whereas with gaming you can play with people from all around the world instantly with an internet connection from the comfort of your own home. eSports sells the dream of going pro. With 83% of teenage girls and 95% of teenage boys playing video games regularly 11 , what could be more exciting than earning your living as a pro gamer, especially compared to traditional careers like being an accountant, lawyer, or sales associateâ€”no offense to people working in those professions. The competition for eSports is fierce, with hundreds of millions of gamers competing for hundreds of spots.

In fact, over 380 million people watch esports worldwide both online and in person . With its fragmented landscape and digital platform, the esports sector holds promise for a multitude of monetization opportunities.
